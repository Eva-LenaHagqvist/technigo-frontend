        <q>An end in the front? What is that?</q>

        <p>
          The main focus of frontend is what the user meets when interacting
          with a website. Frontend ensures that the user gets the information
          they search for. That it´s easy to access and through navigation reach
          the relevant content. It also makes it possible for the user to
          interact with the site, sending information, upload a picture, like,
          swipe etc. This needs to work on computers as well as on other
          devices, like mobile phones or tablets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Frontend also ensures that the information is in a format that is easy
          to read and also reachable for people with disabilities. One way of
          example is by using screenreaders. Among programmers there is a group
          called frontend developers. They are the ones who are responsible for
          making this work.
